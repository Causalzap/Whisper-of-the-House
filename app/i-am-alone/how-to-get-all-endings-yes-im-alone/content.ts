## Core Design Philosophy (Critical to All Endings)
Before any step-by-step guidance, it is essential to understand the game’s foundational rules:

1. **Survival Is Not the Win Condition**: The game does not reward staying alive. Death is frequently a progression gateway.
2. **No Traditional Resources**: Weapons are symbolic triggers. The only true resource is dialogue choice sequencing.
3. **The Visitor Is Not a “Boss”**: The Visitor cannot be killed through conventional means; combat only redirects the narrative.

## Pre-Game Preparation

### Mental Framing
* Do not treat the firearm as a defensive solution.
* Expect the game to punish resistance and reward submission or insight.

### Mechanical Focus
* Every spoken line is permanent. Lying, admitting, or remaining silent carry irreversible narrative weight.



## Main Story Progression Routes

### Initial Encounter: The Knock and the Lie
When asked whether you are alone:
* **Admitting loneliness [K2]** → Triggers immediate death and abrupt termination.

* **Lying and denying solitude [K3]** → Unlocks the escape trial. *Honesty is dangerous unless paired with surrender.*

### Escape Route: The Illusion of Flight
* **Action**: Jumping through the window initiates an outdoor chase. 
* **Outcome**: Running across the burned field always fails, but produces the **“Sunrise Embrace” Ending**. 
* **Insight**: Reframes capture as a gentle, transitional acceptance rather than punishment.

### Good Ending: Coexistence Through Acceptance
This is the widely recognized \"True Resolution.\"
* **Conditions**: Do not flee. Enter the bedroom willingly. During the confrontation, **do not shoot**.
* **Key Choice**: Ask whether you can become a Visitor as well [K5].

* **Result**: You experience a post-death dialogue space and return to reality transformed.

### Stealth Route: Temporary Survival Ending
For players seeking mechanical mastery over philosophical resolution:
1. **Initial Hide**: Hide in the closet.
2. **The Transition [K6]**: After the Visitor checks the room and leaves, immediately relocate to **under the bed**.

3. **Outcome**: The Visitor re-checks the closet and fails to find you.
*Note: This ending is intentionally incomplete, framing survival as mere avoidance.*



## Visitor Mechanics (Verified Behavior Rules)
* **Combat Interaction**: Shooting the Visitor in the head triggers a peaceful afterlife ending rather than a kill.
* **Search Logic**: The Visitor prioritizes bathrooms and closets. Static hiding in one spot results in failure.
* **Common Failure Patterns**: Waiting indefinitely in one spot or attempting melee engagement.

## Final Interpretation: How to Truly “Win”
The game’s logic is internally consistent:
* **Resistance** produces fear-based endings.
* **Stealth** produces avoidance endings.
* **Violence** produces false empowerment.
* **Acceptance** produces resolution.

**Core Takeaway**: Death is a narrative currency. Stop fighting. Start listening. Embrace the change.
