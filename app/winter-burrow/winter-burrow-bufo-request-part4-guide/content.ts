Completing these steps opens Bufo's main mission to find his missing child, Poliwog, and introduces new side quests involving Moss. Resource control and base development structure the entire progression.


## 1. Preparation: Required Materials and Early Priorities

Progress in this chapter depends heavily on acquiring **Granite** and **Wool**, both used for essential tools and survival gear. Players will eventually recognize the need for stronger tools (K1), which immediately sets Granite as a top priority.

### Primary Material Needs

| Objective | Required Materials | Notes |
|-----------|-------------------|-------|
| **Granite Axe** | Granite, Twigs | Ensure actual Granite is collected; Flint does not substitute. (K2) |
| **Trail Ready Backpack** | Sturdy Materials, Wool | Offers a substantial carry-capacity upgrade for exploration. (K11) |
| **Campfire Kit** | Kindling | Keep at least one kit available for outdoor Warmth emergencies. (K5) |

Maintaining Warmth is vital during long-distance tasks, making survival food, a Campfire Kit, and early tool upgrades essential preparation.


## 2. Main Story Progression: Auntie, Bufo, and Poliwog

### 2.1 Healing Auntie and Unlocking Bufo's Mainline
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/deliver-stash-get-healing-tea.webp" alt="Player delivers the stash to Nusk and receives Healing Tea as a reward." loading="lazy" />
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/give-healing-tea-to-auntie.webp" alt="Player gives Healing Tea to Auntie, completing the healing objective." loading="lazy" />

Players who previously completed Nusk's Stash requirement (K4) can already prepare the components for **Healing Tea**. Delivering this tea to Auntie restores her health and reactivates her participation in Burrow development (K6).

<img src="/images/winter-burrow/craft-granite-axe.webp" alt="Player successfully crafts the Granite Axe, enabling further progress." loading="lazy" />
As exploration continues, the need for a more advanced axe becomes clear. Crafting the **Granite Axe** (K7) marks a major turning point, enabling players to advance deeper into the chapter.

Speaking to Bufo after crafting the Granite Axe unlocks the next stage of the storyline: **the investigation to locate Poliwog** (K8). This shifts the narrative into a broader search-and-rescue arc.

### 2.2 Field Exploration and New Character Encounters

While following Poliwog's potential trail, players may encounter **stone cairns**. These serve as memorial markers rather than quest objectives, clarifying that they are unrelated to the missing-child mission (K9).

Exploration eventually leads to **Moss**, who introduces a side task concerning his missing partner Pine Sap (K10). This quest requires gathering **Snow Fox Fur Tufts**, expanding the resource variety needed during this portion of the game.

To support these long-distance tasks, crafting the **Trail Ready Backpack** (K11) becomes a key upgrade. The increased capacity reduces the number of return trips required during various objectives.

## 3. Base Development Challenges and Solutions

The later part of this chapter shifts toward reinforcing the Burrow and improving the character's Warmth protection for upcoming, harsher regions.

### 3.1 Resolving the Planter Box Placement Issue
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/start-auntie-planter-box-quest.webp" alt="Auntie expresses the desire for a garden, triggering the Planter Box building quest." loading="lazy" />

After Auntie recovers, she requests several **Planter Boxes** to prepare a garden space (K12). Players may find that the boxes cannot be placed in the main Burrow due to building restrictions.
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/place-planter-box-in-basement.webp" alt="Player successfully places the Planter Box in basement build mode." loading="lazy" />

The correct placement method involves switching to the **Overground Basement Repair** build view, where the Planter Boxes can be successfully installed (K13). This resolves the construction block and moves Auntie's taskline forward.

### 3.2 Expanding the Burrow and Improving Warmth Defense
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/repair-basement-entry.webp" alt="Player repairs the basement entrance to unlock new space and features." loading="lazy" />

New materials gathered during this chapter allow players to **repair the basement entrance**, opening an expanded underground area for storage and future upgrades (K14).
<img src="/images/winter-burrow/craft-wool-trouserswebp" alt="Player crafts Wool Trousers at the workbench to improve cold resistance." loading="lazy" />

This progress also enables the crafting of **Wool Trousers**, an important Warmth-protective clothing item that greatly improves outdoor survivability (K15). These trousers serve as a significant defensive upgrade before entering colder regions later in the story.

## 4. Chapter Summary

* Delivering Healing Tea stabilizes Auntie and reopens base-building tasks (K6).
* Crafting the Granite Axe (K2, K7) unlocks Bufo's search mission for Poliwog (K8).
