This chapter features light survival challenges, cold-weather navigation, and new resource zones that expand mid-game exploration.

## 1. Preparation Before Departing

Although the game does not enforce strict requirements before entering this chapter, having a minimal survival setup greatly improves efficiency. Food items such as **Hazelnut Biscuits** provide a reliable safety buffer in cold areas, and at least one piece of basic Warmth gear helps maintain stability during prolonged exposure. Bringing a **Pickaxe** is essential, as several blocked passages and cracked walls require it to continue the search for Poliwog (K2).

## 2. Finding Poliwog and Triggering the Quest Chain

### 2.1 Identifying the Correct Path (K1)

The search begins near Bufo's den, where the correct route is a narrow downward passage leading into a deeper part of the forest. This exit can be missed if players follow side paths, so progressing downward is the key to reaching Poliwog's hidden area.

### 2.2 Clearing Obstacles and Managing the Cold (K2, K3)

Deeper in the area, cracked stone walls appear throughout the tunnels. These can be broken with a Pickaxe (K2), opening shortcuts, uncovering optional items, or connecting hidden chambers.

Cold remains a consistent threat during this portion of the quest. Natural heat sources such as **steam vents** temporarily halt or reverse the drop in the Warmth bar (K3), allowing players to navigate without wasting fuel or consumables.

### 2.3 Meeting Poliwog (K4)

Poliwog is found sheltering further inside the cavern network. He is distressed and firmly asks the player not to reveal his location to Bufo (K4). This emotional moment sets the tone for the remainder of the quest: the next objective becomes helping Bufo express his remorse rather than simply reporting Poliwog's location.

Returning to Bufo shortly afterward reveals his intent to build a wooden home, but he lacks the strength he once had. This conversation unlocks the next major objective—crafting a pie to lift his spirits and help him reconcile with Poliwog.

## 3. Gathering Rowanberries and Exploring Frozen Horizons

### 3.1 Collecting Rowanberries (K6)

The pie required for this quest uses **Rowanberries** as a key ingredient. These berries grow abundantly in the southern region known as **Frozen Horizons**, distinguishable by their vibrant red bushes (K6). The area is colder and contains longer travel paths, so Warmth management becomes important.

### 3.2 Evaluating Risk and Withdrawing Safely (K7)

While exploring deeper zones such as areas near the **White Pillars**, players may encounter high-threat enemies, including large spiders (K7). Combat here can be punishing if tools or armor are not sufficiently upgraded. Strategic retreat is encouraged—maintaining Health and Warmth is more important than forcing progression.

## 4. Crafting the Pie and Completing the Reconciliation

### 4.1 Crafting and Delivering the Pie (K8)

Once Rowanberries are collected, the next step is to return home and craft the required pie. Players often prepare additional foods such as **Acorn Biscuits** or **Meaty Pie**, but the important part is presenting Bufo with a pie made from the materials gathered (K8).

Bufo reacts positively to the gift and, moved by the gesture, creates a **hand-carved wooden key**. This key symbolizes his willingness to reconcile and serves as the final bridge between him and Poliwog.

### 4.2 Delivering the Wooden Key to Poliwog (K9)

Returning to Poliwog with the wooden key completes the emotional arc of the quest (K9). Poliwog recognizes Bufo's sincerity and chooses to return home, ending the family conflict. With their reunion, the main quest **"Finding Poliwog"** is officially completed.
