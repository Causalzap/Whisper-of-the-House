## Core Farrier Tasks & Maximizing Efficiency

The foundation of your farrier career lies in perfecting each **core horse-care task**. Every second and every swing of the hammer matters when striving for high ratings and speed bonuses.

### Mastering the Horse Shoeing Flow

#### Step-by-Step: Cleaning Horse Hooves (Scraper and Brush Technique)

Start every session by using the **hoof scraper** to remove debris and stones. Follow up with the **stiff brush** to polish and expose cracks.  
**Pro tip:** clean one hoof at a time to reduce contamination, and always ensure your cleaning meter reaches 100% before proceeding. Missing even 5% can drop your star rating.

#### Precision Guide: Removing Old Horseshoes Without Damage

Removing the old shoe requires **precise angle control**. Tap gently around each nail edge and avoid rushing — overforce can damage the hoof texture and cost score penalties.  
**Shortcut:** long-press for a steady pull rather than quick taps when the horse is calm.

#### Nailing New Horseshoes: Technique for the Accuracy Minigame

This is one of the most **notorious challenges** in the game.  
To succeed:
- Wait for the **green flash timing cue** before hammering.
- Hit lightly until the final swing.
- Watch for **hoof flicks** — stop immediately when the horse becomes restless.

### High-Score and Care Efficiency Strategy

#### Efficient Workflow: Why You Should Clean Hooves Completely First

Avoid switching tools mid-hoof. Completing full cleaning first ensures the dirt algorithm doesn’t reset, which often happens when alternating between scrapers and rasps.

#### Avoiding Mistakes in the Nail Hammering Minigame

Many players lose score points by **overhammering** or striking too fast. Use rhythm:  
> tap – pause – tap – pause – full strike.  

If possible, watch short video replays to learn timing from expert players.

#### Maximizing Your Score: Minimizing Miss-Hits and Delays

Every miss-hit reduces your multiplier. Stick to **3-second task intervals** to maintain combo bonuses. The horse’s patience meter depletes faster on higher days, so act decisively.

### Money and Upgrade Prioritization

#### Best Tool Upgrades to Buy First

Your first investments should go toward:
- **Rasps** – increases shoe-fitting accuracy.
- **Hoof Knives** – speeds trimming by 25%.
Avoid decorative brushes early on; they don’t boost your time score.

#### Investing in Upgrades that Reduce Task Time

Tools that cut **cleaning and hammering time** directly affect your star ranking and income multiplier. Prioritize efficiency over aesthetics early-game.

#### Unlocking New Horses and Decorative Items

After earning consistent 4-star ratings, you’ll unlock exotic breeds like the **Arabian and Mustang**. Decorative saddles and stable décor improve your **Daily Happiness Bonus**.

## Conquering Difficult Minigames and Progression

As you advance, time limits shrink and new conditions appear. Understanding how progression works is key to long-term success.

### Day System and Progression Benchmarks

#### The Official Full "Days" List: Does the Game Have an End?

The campaign progresses through 30 simulated “Days.” After Day 30, a **Free Play Mode** unlocks, allowing endless daily maintenance without time constraints.

#### Understanding Time Limits and Agitated Horse Failures

Each horse has a hidden **patience meter**. Ignoring the horse’s mood (twitching ears, stamping) increases agitation. Once the red icon appears, stop immediately or the horse kicks — instant task failure.

#### Unlocking New Tasks and Specialized Minigames

New minigames appear every 5 days:
- **Day 5:** Shoe forging  
- **Day 10:** Hoof pattern customization  
- **Day 15:** Obstacle jumping  
- **Day 25:** Maze and color path challenges

### Strategy for the Most Difficult Minigames

#### Tips for Cleaning Particularly Dirty Hooves

Use the **zoom-in mode** for hidden dirt zones near the frog (inner hoof area). Rotating the camera prevents missing deep cracks.

#### Guide to Removing Difficult Horseshoes

When faced with **stuck nails**, heat the metal first using the forge minigame. Horses that shift legs require holding “Calm” until they stabilize.

#### Mastering the Obstacle Jumping Minigame

Modeled after retro Gameboy timing games, success depends on rhythm. Count the beats (1–2–jump) to synchronize with sound cues.

#### Solutions for Color Path Puzzle and Maze Challenges

For puzzles, always start from the **top-right path** — 80% of maze generation seeds follow clockwise solvable routes. Memorizing colors improves reaction accuracy.

### Repetitive Tasks and Speeding Up Daily Maintenance

#### Skipping or Speeding Through Repetitive Tasks

Fly removal and brushing sequences can be skipped once **Perfect Completion** is achieved three times. Enable “Quick Routine” under Settings.

#### Community Tips for Faster Hoof Trimming

Use **dual-input control** (two-finger mode) to rasp and hold the hoof simultaneously, reducing time by 20%. Advanced players recommend rhythm audio cues.

## FAQ and Player Troubleshooting

### Common Player Pain Points & Solutions

#### Nail Hammering Difficulty

If your hammer cursor drifts, recalibrate the tool sensitivity in Options → Control. Lag spikes may also affect hammer accuracy; lowering graphic settings often fixes this.

#### Task Completion Bugs

If your “Cleaned” task doesn’t register, ensure no mud residue remains in the inner hoof creases. Restarting the level usually resolves soft-lock issues.

### Secrets and Community-Sourced Questions

#### Hidden Horses and Tools

Players report hidden unlockables — e.g., the **Golden Rasp** on Day 20 with all 5-star ratings, or the **Phantom Stallion** accessible via the color puzzle sequence.

#### Skill Tips and Video Tutorials

For precise nail hammering, align the **white impact reticle** with nail edges. Watching slow-motion replays from the leaderboard helps master timing.

#### Saving and Sharing Designs

As of the latest patch, player-created **hoof and shoe designs** can be shared via the “Stable Share” menu. Expect future updates adding community exchange functions.
