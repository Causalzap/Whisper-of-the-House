## Essential Gameplay Mechanics and Physics Explained

**Core physics you actually use while building**

- **Center of Mass (CoM):** Keep mass centered over the trunk or over anchored branches to reduce tipping torque.  
- **Torque & Lever Arms:** Torque = *Force × Distance*. Long, heavy overhangs (cantilevers) multiply torque and crush your Stability Score.  
- **Triangles > Squares:** A triangle braces itself; a square without diagonal bracing becomes a rhombus under load.  
- **Stiffness vs. Damping:** Stiffer isn’t always safer. A lightly flexible structure with damping (cross-braces, guy-lines) survives wind by dissipating energy.

### The Stability Score System: How to Maximize Rigidity

**Core concepts: structural rigidity & weight distribution**

- **Rigidity:** Achieved by **triangulation** and **short members** between nodes.  
- **Weight Distribution:** Place **heavier items low/near the trunk**, lighter decor up high. Symmetry helps; asymmetry must be countered with anchors.

**Actionable Tip — Triangular Support Structures**

1. Convert every rectangle to **two triangles** with a diagonal brace.  
2. Prefer **isosceles triangles** (balanced angles) for even stress.  
3. Cross-brace long spans (X-pattern) to prevent lateral sway.

**Actionable Tip — Avoiding Cantilever Mistakes**

- Keep overhangs **< 30–40%** of the support span unless anchored.  
- If you must cantilever, **stack compression members on top** and **tension ties below** (a simple truss).  
- Add a **drop post** or **guy-line** at the free end to shorten the lever arm dramatically.

### Conquering Wind Sway and Utilizing Support Anchors

**Mechanism Deep Dive — Why “Wind Sway” causes oscillation**

- The tree + house behaves like a **mass–spring–damper** system.  
- Too stiff + low damping ⇒ large oscillations after gusts.  
- **Goal:** keep the natural frequency **away from** wind gust cadence and **increase damping**.

**Strategy — Anchor Placement for Maximum Stabilization**

- **Anchor to structure nodes**, not to panels: connect ropes/struts where beams meet.  
- **Spread anchor angles** (30–60° from vertical) to resist both lift and lateral pull.  
- Use **short, direct anchors** on the windward side; slightly longer, angled anchors leeward for controlled give.

**Pro Tip — Balanced Flexibility**

- Mix **one stiff path** (primary load path to trunk) with **one or two flexible damped paths** (guy-lines/cross-braces).  
- Avoid all-stiff designs; controlled flex reduces peak loads and boosts score consistency.

### The Role of Decorations and Unlockables

**Do decorations affect scoring?**

- **If it has mass, it affects stability.** Heavy décor up high hurts scores; place them **close to supports**.  
- Light items near the CoM are essentially free.

**Unlocking new parts, themes, and cozy rooms**

- **Progression loop:** Complete stability milestones → unlock stronger beams, lighter platforms, diagonal braces, and themed décor.  
- Prioritize unlocks that provide **lightweight floors**, **diagonal braces**, and **adjustable anchors** before purely cosmetic themes.

## Advanced Building Strategies and Challenge Mode Tips

### Mastering the Different Game Modes

**Quick Stacking (speed builds)**

- Use a **repeatable scaffold**: central trunk post → ring beam → four diagonals → short platforms.  
- Pre-plan **3-node triangles** so every placement adds stiffness, not just area.  
- Keep inventory light; **reuse a micro-kit** (2 beams + 1 brace) in loops.

**Full Design Sessions (precision builds)**

- Start with a **load map**: where are heavy rooms (kitchen/forge/pond)? Put them **low and central**.  
- Create **service triangles** (hidden braces behind walls) so the visible façade stays clean without losing rigidity.  
- Add **progressive anchoring**: temporary guys during early spans, replaced with permanent cross-braces later.

### Level & Task Objectives: Overcoming Building Constraints

**Build on a single branch**

- Use a **V-truss**: two diagonals meeting under the platform, apex at the branch.  
- Convert long floorboards into **shorter segments** with in-line nodes; more nodes = more paths for load.

**Meet high height requirements**

- Build **in tiers**: platform → mast → small platform → guy-line ring.  
- Every new tier must have **its own triangle cage** before adding weight above it.

**Succeed with limited materials**

- Prioritize **diagonals over extra floors**. One brace can replace multiple beams worth of stiffness.  
- **Shorten spans** by adding **intermediate posts** or **hanging ties** from upper branches.

### Solving the Tree House Maker Physics Puzzles

**General puzzle approach**

1. **Identify failure mode:** tipping, sagging, or oscillation.  
2. **Shorten the lever arm:** move mass inward, add drop post or anchor.  
3. **Add triangles where motion occurs**, not randomly.  
4. **Introduce damping:** a slightly angled brace or a tension tie that isn’t fully rigid.

**Example patterns**

- **Tipping corner:** add a **low diagonal** from the trunk to the corner most prone to lift.  
- **Bouncy mid-span:** split span with a **king post** and two diagonals (simple truss).  
- **Sway under gusts:** cross-brace **two perpendicular planes** (X on floor plane + X on wall plane).

## FAQ and Troubleshooting (Unblocked / Pain Points)

### Tree House Maker Unblocked — What You Need to Know

**About alternate/embedded versions (e.g., minigames portals)**

- Expect **ad wrappers**, possible **reduced graphics/physics iteration**, and sometimes **disabled cloud saves** depending on the host.  
- If performance dips, **lower deco count**, shorten spans, and rely on **fewer, smarter braces** rather than many small parts.

**Ad-related differences**

- Ads may **interrupt build flow**; finish a stability-critical triangle before any break to avoid coming back to a half-braced span.  
- If input delay appears after an ad, **toggle pause → resume** to resync physics.

### Player Q&A and Common Pain Points

**Q: I keep failing due to material/time limits—what’s the priority order?**  
A: **Brace first, span later.** Turn every rectangle into two triangles, then add only the spans necessary to reach objectives.

**Q: What does instant restart really do for my score?**  
A: It resets the simulation state and lets you **iterate on the last failure mode** quickly. Replay the final 2–3 placements with a brace-first mindset.

**Q: My build “looks” strong but the Stability Score is low. Why?**  
A: Hidden flex at joints. Add **short diagonals at the wobbly node**, or move mass inward to reduce torque.

**Q: Common bugs/workarounds?**  
- **Node snapping offset:** Zoom in and attach from the **receiving node** outward.  
- **Phantom oscillation after long sessions:** **Save → reload** to clear accumulative drift.  
- **Anchor visually connected but no effect:** Reattach to a **beam junction**, not a panel face.

**Q: How do I save and share designs?**  
- Use **save slots** frequently (pre- and post-bracing).  
- Export or screenshot the **frame with exposed braces** so others can learn the load paths.  
- If the portal version lacks cloud save, **download local blueprint** (if supported) or keep a **versioned image log**.

### Final Builder’s Mindset

Aim for **predictable load paths** and **controlled flexibility**. If something moves, **brace there**; if something tips, **shorten the lever**. Master these two habits and both your **Stability Score** and your tallest, coziest tree houses will follow.
