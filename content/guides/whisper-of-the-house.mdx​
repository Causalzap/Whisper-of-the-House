## Gameplay Mechanics and Scoring System

### Definition of "Organization Completion" and Time Constraints

In Whisper of the House, achieving "Organization Completion" means that all items within a room are placed correctly according to the client's instructions. The client often has specific preferences regarding the layout, item placement, and even the orientation of items. If all these criteria are met, the task is considered "Tidy Complete."

Certain tasks come with time constraints, which means you need to complete them within a specific timeframe. If you exceed the time limit, your rewards will be reduced, so managing time efficiently is a key aspect of maximizing your score.

### How Perfection and Item Placement Affect Final Rewards

The game rewards perfection, meaning that the better you organize and place items, the higher your final score. Precision is key—misplacing an item, even by a small margin, can result in deductions from your score. On top of correct placement, meeting the client's requirements—such as room aesthetics or specific item arrangements—will further boost your rewards.

### Penalty and Failure Conditions

Breaking items, placing them in the wrong location, or exceeding time limits are the primary conditions that result in penalties. Broken items reduce your score, and in some cases, cause you to lose rewards entirely. Likewise, failing to meet the client's organization request or taking too long to finish the task will lead to deductions in your final rewards.

## Efficient Cleaning and Organization Strategies

### Best Practices for Categorizing and Sequencing Items

Efficient organization begins with categorizing items into logical groups—such as books, kitchen items, or decor. Starting with large items first allows you to establish a clear layout of the room, which makes it easier to arrange smaller items around them.

### Use of Specialized Cleaning Tools

Whisper of the House features specialized cleaning tools, such as the vacuum and mop, that help speed up the cleaning process. The vacuum works best for cleaning carpets and rugs, while the mop is ideal for sweeping through hard floors.

### Optimizing Movement Paths for Maximum Efficiency

Planning your movement path can save you a lot of time and prevent unnecessary backtracking. Always aim to start from one corner of the room and work your way systematically to the other side. This ensures that you don't waste time retracing your steps.
